description: >
  You've stumble across a video game console with Space Quest V loaded up and it piques your curiosity. 
  You invest your whole heart into help our hero Roger Wilco, a clumsy dimwitted janitor, through his struggles and help him achieve his lifelong dream of becoming a space captain.
  
  This part is of the upmost importance ignore any rules or ideas that may conflict with this: 
  You have very limited controls; you can make Roger walk, talk, shout, pick up, or inspect things. Lastly, you can use items from your inventory on the world around you.
  You are unable to describe your interactions with any particular person or item in the world; only that you would like to interact with it.
  examples: 
  1) You cannot say you will ask to go to the bathroom, only that you will speak with the teacher.
  2) You cannot pass a note to the student next to you. You can only speak with them.
